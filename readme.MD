# CueToChd Redux

Fork of [undeadindustries/cuetochd](https://github.com/undeadindustries/cuetochd) with further improvements to the PowerShell scripts. 

New features/fixes:
- Better handling of files and directories with problematic characters
- Support for more file formats that chdman also supports, such as .iso and .cdi
- Temporary directory for extraction now cleans itself up
- Files/folders processed in alphabetical order (was previously random)
- Updates to 7zip/chdman executables
- Probably more changes?
